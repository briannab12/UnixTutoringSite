					Already have an idea of what unix is and how to use it? Thats great! Now it's time to learn about all the different 
					programs you can use to advance your coding experience. In this tutorial we will discuss a program called Vim; what it is, 
					how to open and edit files with it, and how to exit the program. Weâ€™ll also introduce you to other programs like Atom, 
					Brackets and Filezilla. Lets get started!
